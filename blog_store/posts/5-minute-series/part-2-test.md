# 5 Minutes to Setting Up A Blog
#### December 16, 2022

Hi. 

This is my second post. Hopefully GH actions will run from this.

```js

const test = () => "Hello"

```

In this post I will teach you how to brew lovely beans.

I can't cook.

It's 6:40pm and I am still trying to build this. I think I gitignored dist and that is why I am unable to serve the site.
