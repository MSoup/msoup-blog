# Introduction to 5 Minutes
#### January 7, 2020

Hi. I have an extremely short attention span, and if you do too, then I may have created a resource that's perfect for you to learn from.

All my posts in this series will be 5 minutes, plus or minutes 30 seconds to read. 

Why? Because that's the limit of my own attention span. Unless it is something I am passionate about (this includes coding, weight lifting, and Dance Dance Revolution), it's very difficult for me to sit still and spend more than 5 minutes focused on a task. 

*Welcome*

## This is a subtitle heading.

Can it render code well?

```py
def test():
    return "This is a test"
```
